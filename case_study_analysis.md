# 📝 Case Study Analysis – Climate Resilience for Agriculture in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh

## 📊 1. Climate Data Analysis 

We collected and processed **10 years of daily temperature and precipitation data** for Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. The datasets included:

- Daily **mean, max, and min temperature**
- Daily **rainfall in mm**

Using this, we generated **trend line graphs** to visualize long-term climate behavior in both states.

We also computed four **climate resilience indicators**:

| Indicator               | What it tells us                     |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 🌡️ Temperature Mean     | Average climate condition over time  |
| 🔄 Temperature Variability | How much temperature fluctuates     |
| 🌧️ Rainfall Total        | Total water available via rainfall   |
| 🌩️ Rainfall Variability  | How unpredictable rainfall is        |

These indicators provide insight into **climate stability**, helping in agricultural planning.

## 🌾 2. Crop Performance Analysis 🚧 *[To be Enhanced]*

Right now, crop-level performance like **yield trends, crop failures, or NDVI-based health** is **not included** due to data limitations.

However, based on standard crop cycles:

### 📍 Key Crops by Season

**Madhya Pradesh**
- Kharif: Soybean (SB), Paddy (PA)
- Rabi: Wheat (WH), Gram (GM)

**Maharashtra**
- Kharif: Cotton (CO), Soybean (SB)
- Rabi: Wheat (WH), Gram (GM)

➡️ In future work, we plan to use **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** for NDVI analysis to monitor:
- Crop health over time
- Yield consistency
- Climate-related crop failures

## 💰 3. Economic Impact 🚧 *[To be Added]*

At present, **economic indicators** like:
- Farmer income/loss
- Insurance claims
- Crop damage estimates

.are **not available**, so the economic impact of climate variability isn't included yet.

📌 Future enhancement can link weather shifts to real losses through farmer reports or government records.

## ⚙️ 4. Infrastructure & Technology 🧪 *[Recommendations]*

We recommend considering **resilience-focused infrastructure** such as:

- ✅ **Drip irrigation**
- ✅ **Rainwater harvesting**
- ✅ **Solar pumps**
- ✅ **Mobile weather alerts**

These tech solutions can help reduce risks from droughts or erratic rainfall.

## 🏛 5. Government Policies & Support 📜

Several schemes already aim to support climate-smart agriculture:

| Policy | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| PM-FBY | Crop insurance |
| PM-KISAN | Income support |
| Soil Health Card | Soil quality for better planning |
| Agri Infra Fund | Financial support for infrastructure |

📌 In this version, we haven't assessed **their effectiveness**. Including **adoption data** in the future would provide stronger insights.

## ✅ 6. Recommendations

### 📌 Indicator Monitoring Plan

| Indicator | Monitor Frequency | Purpose |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| Temp Mean | Monthly | Helps in adjusting crop calendars |
| Temp Variability | Seasonal | Detects climate stress |
| Rainfall Total | Weekly (during monsoon) | Irrigation decisions |
| Rainfall Variability | Monthly | Assess drought/flood risks |
| NDVI (Future) | Every 15 days | Tracks crop health remotely |

## 📢 Final Suggestions

- Set up **early warning dashboards** using real-time weather feeds
- Promote **short-duration or drought-tolerant crops**
- Invest in **soil and water conservation methods**
- Use **NDVI** and remote sensing for crop health monitoring

## 🚀 Conclusion

This project provides a solid foundation for **climate resilience analysis in agriculture**.

✅ What we’ve built:
- A modular codebase
- Visual insights via Streamlit
- Climate indicators to assess stability

With added layers like **NDVI, economic impact, and policy mapping**, this dashboard can grow into a **decision-support system** for  both farmers and policymakers.
